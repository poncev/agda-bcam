<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
    Type theory is a flavour of constructive mathematics where every mathematical object is of a certain type.
    From this perspective, propositions become types, and their proofs become programs inhabiting their corresponding type.
</p>

<p>
    Agda is a functional programming language that tastes like Haskell and features dependent types, data types that depend on values, e.g., the type of lists of a given length.
    Agda is not just a programming language, but also a proof assistant: it enables one to construct proofs interactively, and to use the machine to check for the correctness of their proofs.
</p>

<p>
    This tutorial will serve as a brief introduction to theorem proving using the proof assistant Agda.
    I will introduce some common definitions and demonstrate machine assisted theorem proving at work.
