<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  This course is a brief introduction to Agda, a functional programming language
  with dependent types. Dependent types are types that depend on values,
  something which, as we will see during this course, allows us to provide very
  detailed specifications for our programs. In fact, such is the power of
  dependently typed programming that it blurs the lines between computer
  programming and theorem proving: theorems in constructive mathematics become
  types in Agda, and proofs of those theorems become computable programs that
  inhabit their corresponding types. This correspondence enables us to
  completely mechanise mathematical concepts, using the machine to check the
  correctness of our proofs, or even to aid us in their construction.
