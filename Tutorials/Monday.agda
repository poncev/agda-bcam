  -- The record keyword creates a record type
  -- Records have a single constructor

    -- Agda offers support for mixfix notation
    -- We use the underscores to specify where the arguments goal

    -- A × B itself is of type Set, i.e. a type
    -- We use the single record constructor _,_ to make something of type A × B

  -- Some simple proofs!
  --------

  -- In constructive mathematics logical implication is modelled as function types
  -- An object of type A → B shows that assuming an object of type A, we can construct an object of type B
  -- Below we want to show that assuming an object of type A × B, we can construct an object of type A
  -- We want to show that this is the case regardless of what A and B actually are
  -- We do this using a polymorphic function that is parametrised over A and B, both of type Set
  -- We use curly braces {} to make these function parameters implicit
  -- When we call this function we won't have to supply the arguments A and B unless we want to
  -- When we define this function we won't have to accept A and B as arguments unless we want to
  -- The first line below gives the type of the function get-fst
  -- The second line gives its definition

  -- Agda is an *interactive* proof assistant
  -- We don't provide our proofs/programs all at once: we develop them iteratively
  -- We write ? where we don't yet have a program to provide, and we reload the file
  -- What we get back is a hole where we can place the cursor and have a conversation with Agda

  -- ctrl+c ctrl+l     reload the file
  -- ctrl+c ctrl+,     shows the goal and the context
  -- ctrl+c ctrl+.     shows the goal, the context, and what we have so far
  -- ctrl+c ctrl+c     pattern matches against a given arguments
  -- ctrl+c ctrl+space fill in hole
  -- ctrl+c ctrl+r     refines the goal: it will ask Agda to insert the first constructor we need
  -- ctrl+c ctrl+a     try to automatically fulfill the goal
